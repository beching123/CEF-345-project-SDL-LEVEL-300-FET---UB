  Welcome to the    NETLINK repository!

  🌐 NetLink

Connecting People, Improving Networks.

📘 Project Overview

NetLink is a community-driven platform designed to help users report poor network coverage in their area.
Through the app, users can submit their location, network provider, and a short description of the issue.
This data helps:

Telecom companies identify and fix coverage problems faster.

Users check network strength before moving to new locations.

Communities discover nearby areas with better connectivity.


  This project uses Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. We've implemented branch to protection rules and a Pull Request (PR) workflow to ensure our codebase remains stable and well-maintained.

  ## Getting started 

  To contribute to this project, please follow the workflow outlined below.

  ## Our Code Workflow: Branching & Pull REquests

  We use a "Pull Request (PR) workflow" to manage all code changes. This means:

  1.   No direct pushes to the main branch. All code must go through a review process.
  2.   Code is reviewed by at least one team member before it can be merged.
  3.   Force pushes are blocked on `main` to prevent accidental history changes.

  ## How to contribute Code

  The Golden Rule: NEVER work directly on the `main` branch. Always create a new branch for your work.

  ### 1. Update our local `main` Branch

  Before starting any new work, ensure you local `main` branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from GitHub.


  ## Note: if you do not know how to do any of the above, "please do a detailed research before doing any action" as it is of great importance to you and great issue to the group work if you cause any accident.

  more info will be added later. Stunned
